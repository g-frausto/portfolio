title: Electric Bus Power Forecasting with RNNs
---

# Electric Bus Power Forecasting  

## Overview  
This project focuses on forecasting power consumption for electric buses as they commute along their regular routes. We evaluated the performance of three different Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs):  

- **Vanilla RNN**  
- **Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)**  
- **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**  

Additionally, we tested the models' ability to forecast multiple time steps into the future, assessing their reliability for real-world deployment.  

## Key Contributions  
- Preprocessed and structured time-series data for model training.  
- Implemented and compared RNN, GRU, and LSTM architectures for multi-step forecasting.  
- Evaluated model performance using RMSE, MAE, and time-series error metrics.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Programming:** Python (NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib)  
- **Machine Learning:** PyTorch,   
- **Time-Series Modeling:** RNN, GRU, LSTM
