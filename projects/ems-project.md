# Energy Management System with Deep Reinforcement Learning

## Overview
This project applies Deep Q-Learning (DQN), Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) to optimize energy consumption in a simulated environment.

## Key Contributions
- Developed a custom environment for energy optimization.
- Implemented state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning algorithms.
- Optimized policy performance and cost minimization.

## Technologies Used
- Python (PyTorch, NumPy, pandas)
- Deep Reinforcement Learning (PPO, DQN, DDPG)
- Energy Management Simulation
