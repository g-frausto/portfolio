## [Symmetry Reduction of Gravitational Lagrangians](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2410.11036)  
**Accepted in Physical Review D**  

### Overview  
This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of all possible symmetry reductions of Lagrangians in four-dimensional metric theories of gravity. We identify group actions that obey the Principle of Symmetric Criticality (PSC), classify their corresponding invariant metrics, and explore the implications for gravitational field equations.  

### Key Contributions  
- Provided a **complete classification** of infinitesimal group actions that satisfy PSC, using Lie algebra pairs of isometries and their isotropy subalgebras.  
- Applied **Fels and Torre’s formalism** to rigorously establish symmetry reduction conditions.  
- Recast Hicks’ classification into a coordinate system where known symmetries and geometries are more easily recognizable.  
- Analyzed **residual diffeomorphism freedom** and Noether identities both before and after variation.  
- Developed a computational tool in **Mathematica's `xAct` package** to automate the symmetry reduction of gravitational Lagrangians.  

### Why It Matters  
This work provides a systematic foundation for applying symmetry reduction in gravitational theories, offering a clear classification and computational framework for researchers studying metric field theories.
